<h3 align="center">A Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo</h3>

In my projects, I'm currently working on one called distributed-compute-locally (named distributor on github), a simple pypi package that allows you to use compute from your local devices by simply connecting them via your local network. So far it has amassed 700+ downloads (without mirrors) and I'm looking to implement more features :). 

On the side, I've started contributing on the Linux Kernel! Here is a link to my [patches](https://lore.kernel.org/all/?q=f:neelb2403@gmail.com) where I contributed to the IIO and Greybus subsystems.

Currently working as a Data Engineer, developing reliable data pipelines and implementing distributed computing methodologies to distribute workloads.
