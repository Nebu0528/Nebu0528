In my side projects, I'm currently working on one called distributed-compute-locally (named distributor on github), a simple pypi package that allows you to use compute from your local devices by simply connecting them via your local network. So far it has amassed 700+ downloads (without mirrors) and I'm looking to implement more features :). 

I also work as a Data Engineer, developing reliable data pipelines and implementing distributed computing methodologies to distribute workloads.
