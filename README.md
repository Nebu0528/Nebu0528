<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Neel</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo</h3>

I have one year of professional experience in Cloud Infrastructure, Data Engineering, and Full-Stack Development. My side projects reflect the skills and experiences gained during my internships, ranging from building analytics dashboards, developing fullstack applications/websites and to fine-tuning machine learning models.

Current interning as a Data Engineer from May 2025 - August 2025, given the nature of my current work term, I will be inactive on github.
